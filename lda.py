I see the penitentiary, one day,And runnin from the police, that's right,Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside,And even as a crack fiend, mama,You always was a black queen, mama,I finally understand,for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man,You always was committed,A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it,There's no way I can pay you back,But the plan is to show you that I understand,You are appreciated,,[Chorus: Reggie Green  Sweet Franklin  w/ 2Pac],,Lady...,Don't cha know we love ya?
